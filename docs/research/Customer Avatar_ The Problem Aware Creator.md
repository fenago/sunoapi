# Customer Avatar: The Problem Aware Creator

## Stage of Awareness: Problem Aware

**“I have so many ideas for songs, but I get stuck trying to make them real. It’s like the music is trapped in my head.”**

This avatar represents the individual who feels a strong, undeniable urge to create music but is acutely aware of their limitations. They have identified the core problem—a gap between their creative vision and their technical ability—but they are not yet aware of the specific solutions or tools that can bridge that gap. They are actively feeling the frustration of this disconnect and are beginning to seek a way out, even if they don’t know what it looks like.

### A → Who Are They

*   **Job:** Freelance Graphic Designer
*   **Household Income:** $55,000/year
*   **Marital Status:** Single
*   **Education Level:** Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Graphic Design

Alex is a 27-year-old freelance graphic designer living in a moderately sized city, like Austin or Portland. They are a digital native, highly creative, and have a keen aesthetic sense, which they apply to their professional work. Their income is decent but can be unpredictable, a common trait of freelance life. This financial reality makes them cautious about significant monthly expenses but willing to invest in tools that provide clear value and a potential return on investment, either through skill development or direct monetization. Alex is single and values their independence, pouring their energy into their creative pursuits and a close-knit group of friends. Their BFA has given them a solid foundation in creative theory and project-based work, but it has also instilled a sense of perfectionism that can be paralyzing.

*   **5 Major Values They Hold:**
    1.  **Authenticity:** They believe in expressing their true self and despise anything that feels fake or manufactured.

    4.  **Growth:** They have a deep desire to learn and improve their skills, both personally and professionally.
    5.  **Impact:** They want their work, whether design or music, to resonate with others and have a positive effect.

*   **2 Major Life Victories:**
    1.  **Successfully launching their freelance career:** Leaving a stable but soul-crushing agency job to go independent was terrifying, but they made it work. This victory taught them they are resilient and capable.
    2.  **Winning a local design award:** This external validation of their creative talent was a massive confidence boost and helped them overcome a period of intense imposter syndrome.

*   **2 Major Life Failures:**

    2.  **A failed collaborative project:** They once tried to start a band with friends, but it fell apart due to creative differences and a lack of structure, leaving them wary of collaboration.

### D → Smart Market Questions

*   **What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:** The fear that they will never be able to fully express the creative ideas trapped inside them. The anxiety that they are wasting their potential and that their best ideas will die in their head. They worry that they are a “fraudulent” artist—good at one thing (design) but a failure at what they truly love (music).

*   **What are they secretly afraid of in life:** Being creatively irrelevant. They fear a future where they are just a cog in the machine, churning out uninspired commercial work, having never created anything that was truly *theirs*.

*   **What are they angry about, and who are they angry at:** They are angry at the gatekeeping in the music industry. They feel that you need expensive gear, years of formal training, and the “right” connections to even have a chance. They are angry at themselves for not starting earlier and for being so easily intimidated by the technical complexity of music production.

*   **Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:**
    1.  Opening a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) like Ableton, feeling a surge of creative energy, and then having it immediately extinguished by the overwhelming interface and infinite options.
    2.  Hearing a song they love and thinking, “I could make something like this,” but having no idea where to even begin with the chord progression, sound design, or drum pattern.
    3.  Spending hours on YouTube watching tutorials, only to end up more confused and feeling like they’ve wasted a whole evening without creating anything.

*   **Biggest secret desire in life:** To have their own radio station on the platform, a curated space where they can share their original music and the music of other undiscovered artists they admire. They dream of someone messaging them to say, “Your song was the soundtrack to my morning. It completely changed my day.”

*   **Built-in bias to how they make decisions:** They are biased towards tools and platforms that are aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and have a strong community aspect. They will choose a slightly less powerful but more user-friendly option every time. They are skeptical of anything that promises “instant success” and are drawn to platforms that feel authentic and creator-focused.

*   **Common words or language unique to them:** “Vibe,” “aesthetic,” “workflow,” “imposter syndrome,” “creative block,” “soundscape,” “gatekeeping,” “lo-fi,” “DAWless,” “sample pack.”

*   **Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:**
    1.  “DAWs like Ableton and Logic are too complicated. It feels like I need an engineering degree to use them.”
    2.  “Splice and other sample packs are cool, but it feels like I’m just arranging someone else’s music, not creating my own.”
    3.  “I don’t have the money for all the expensive plugins and hardware everyone says you need to sound professional.”

### E → Going Deep

*   **Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions:**
    1.  **Frustration:** A constant, simmering feeling of being stuck and unable to progress.
    2.  **Anxiety:** The fear of failure and the pressure to be creative on demand.
    3.  **Envy:** Seeing other, seemingly less-talented people release music and build an audience while they remain on the sidelines.

*   **Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem:**
    1.  **Flow:** The feeling of being completely immersed in the creative process, where time disappears and ideas come effortlessly.
    2.  **Pride:** The deep satisfaction of listening to a finished track that they created from scratch, something that was once just an idea in their head.
    3.  **Connection:** The joy of sharing their music with others and having it resonate, creating a bond through shared emotion and experience.

*   **Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:**
    1.  “Everyone has a creative spark within them, but the world tries to extinguish it.”
    2.  “Technology should be a tool for empowerment, not a barrier to entry.”
    3.  “The most meaningful connections are built through shared art and vulnerability.”

*   **Biggest Lifestyle Desire:** To achieve a state of “creative fluency,” where they can seamlessly move between their design work and music creation, with each pursuit feeding the other. They want a life where their income is stable, but their creative expression is unbounded.

### F → Purchasing Habits

*   **Top 3 Decision Triggers:**
    1.  **Community Recommendation:** A strong recommendation from a trusted influencer or a vibrant community on Reddit or Discord is the most powerful trigger.
    2.  **Intuitive User Experience:** A free trial or demo that feels immediately intuitive and fun will quickly win them over.
    3.  **Emotional Connection:** Marketing that speaks directly to their creative frustration and offers a vision of empowerment and flow.

*   **Prior Purchases For This Pain:**
    *   A subscription to Skillshare for Ableton courses (which they never finished).
    *   A cheap MIDI keyboard that is now collecting dust.
    *   Several Udemy courses on music theory that they found too academic and dry.

*   **Price Tolerance For Offer:** Alex is comfortable with a subscription model in the **$8-$29/month** range. They would be hesitant to go higher unless there was a clear path to monetization. They are a prime candidate for the **Creator Pro** tier, as the promise of commercial rights and advanced features would justify the cost as a business expense for their creative career.

*   **Time Horizon Of Solution:** They want to see results quickly. While they understand mastery takes time, they need to be ableto create a “decent-sounding” loop or short song within the first few hours of using a platform to stay motivated. They are looking for a solution that offers immediate gratification with a high ceiling for growth.

### G → Primary Wants

*   **Wants to gain:** Technical skills, confidence, a finished portfolio of songs, a community of collaborators, and a source of passive income.
*   **Wants to be:** Seen as a legitimate musician, a multi-disciplinary artist, a creative force, and a tastemaker.
*   **Wants to do:** Finish songs consistently, collaborate with other artists, play their music for friends, and maybe even perform a live set one day.
*   **Wants to save:** Time spent on frustrating technical hurdles, money on unnecessary gear, and creative energy.
*   **Wants to avoid:** Feeling like a failure, creative burnout, technical overwhelm, and the judgment of “real” musicians.

### H → Empathy Map

*   **Seeing:** Their friends releasing music on Spotify. Perfectly curated artist profiles on Instagram. Complex Ableton tutorials on YouTube. Ads for expensive plugins. Their own folder of dozens of unfinished project files.

*   **Thinking:** “Why is this so hard for me?” “Am I just not talented enough?” “If I could just get this one idea out of my head, it would be amazing.” “Maybe I should just stick to design.” “Is there an easier way to do this?”

*   **Hearing:** Friends asking, “How’s that music stuff going?” Influencers saying, “You just have to grind for 10,000 hours.” The pristine, professional sound of their favorite artists. The inner critic telling them their ideas aren’t good enough.

*   **Feeling:** Frustrated, overwhelmed, anxious, jealous, but also hopeful and creatively restless. A deep yearning to express themselves.

*   **Saying:** “I’m trying to get into music production.” “I have this idea for a song…” “Yeah, I use Ableton, but I’m still learning.” “It’s just a hobby for now.”

*   **Doing:** Watching endless tutorials. Starting new projects and abandoning them. Curating playlists. Talking about making music more than actually making it. Searching for “easy music production software” on Google. Google.
